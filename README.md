source code1:From the above given list I have found the minimum and maximum ages of students and also added the minimum and maximum age to the list again and also found the median age by  dividing it by two and average by adding all the items and then dividing by their number and at last finding the range of the ages.
source code 2:first I had created an empty dictionary and name it as dog, then added the name , color, breed, legs and age to the dog dictionary. And then I have created a student dictionary and added keys as , country, city, the first_name, last_name, gender, age ,marital status, skills, country, city and address. I found the length of the student dictionary checking the data type and modify the skills values and adding one or two skills and finally getting the dictionary keys and dictionary values as a list.
source code 3:I have created a tuple and given names of my brothers and sisters and join them and assigned them to siblings. I made modifications for the sibling tuple and added the name of my father and mother and assigned it as family_members.
source code 4:	I have found the length of the set it_companies and added twitter to the set it_companies and also inserted multiple IT companies to the set it_companies and differentiated the remove and discard. Then joined the tuples A and B and found the A and B intersection and found that if A subset  of B then the looking at if A and B are disjoint sets and the joined the A with B and B with A and finding the symmetric difference between A and B and then deleting the sets completely and converted the ages to a set and compare the length of the list and the set. 
source code 5:we are trying to find the area and circumference of a circle by mentioning the radius.
source code 6: to find the count of unique words in a  string. I have considered the string “I am a teacher and I love to inspire and teach people” from which the count of unique words is found. Used a set to convert the list into a set.
